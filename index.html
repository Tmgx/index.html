<h1>Top Ten Signs You Have Been Spending Too Much Time Web Surfing".</h1>

<ol>
	<li>
		You’ve experienced almost losing your mind because you had too many windows & tabs opened and couldn’t locate the obnoxious ad that kept playing in one of ‘em. It requires a Liam Neeson in Taken type aggression to search for, find and eliminate that pesky window.
	</li>
			<br>
	<li>
		Making a joke and hearing crickets does a number on your psyche, but it’s not nearly as emotionally taxing as zero likes on what you consider a clever status. Likes and retweets are basically the stuff your confidence is made of. 20+ Facebook likes can pole-vault you from Steve Urkel to Stefan Urquelle.
	</li>	
			<br>
	<li>
		You know your debit card number, the expiration date, and even the security code on the back by heart, because of your constant online shopping habits.
	</li>
			<br>
	<li>
		You sometimes recognize certain stock photo models from seeing their cheesy faces on numerous websites.
	</li>	
			<br>
	<li>
		You’ve learned about every big news story in recent memory via Twitter. In your defense, the reliability of random folks spread out across the globe often exceeds our incompetent news stations, which are constantly inaccurately reporting and/or misinforming the masses with hidden agendas.
	</li>
			<br>
	<li>
		You’re well aware what random, irrelevant entertainers and musicians are up to. If you’ve got the skinny on what Fred Durst was doing a few weeks ago, well that’s just some information you probably shouldn’t know.
	</li>
			<br>
	<li>
		There are few crises in the world that you fear more than a malfunctioning Wi-Fi connection. When that green or blue light turns orange or red, and you know this is going to leave you detached for more than just a moments, you freak. It basically feels as if you and the earth are parting ways.
	</li>
			<br>
	<li>
		You’re anticipating the day hashtags are embraced in the professional world so you can do things like write #Qualified on your résumé.
	</li>
			<br>
	<li>
		Watching television shows and movies on an actual TV has become a rarity for you. Hulu, Netflix, and illegal streaming/downloading (HA! Kidding, of course we don’t do that) have become your go-to methods of indulging yourself.
	</li>
			<br>
	<li>
		You’ve taken the previous point a step further by not even owning a TV. And not because you’re one of those smug, meh-I-don’t-watch-television-I’m-too-busy-being-a-vegan-and-signing-internet-petitions-for-important-causes people, but because you just don’t need one with your numerous other resources.
